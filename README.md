# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Introduction  

This is the *pulsing embryo* of a social media site called "Around The U.S."... or rather, it's a project meant to emulate such a thing. The main focus thus far has been
responsive design: ensuring that the page displays correctly across various resolutions. This was done using two flexboxes for the "profile information" and a grid for
the various "posts". The site also changes formats slightly at 920px and 620px (every time the grid drops a column due to lack of space) through the use of media queries
at said resolutions. These changes are meant to support resolutions from >1280px to 320px. While the site is currently only composed of static images and text, over time
(and with the expenditure of blood, sweat, and tears) the site will gain increased functionality until it emulates a social media site resembling Instagram.
~~Or at least that's what I think is supposed to happen, they don't tell me much about the future during the now.~~
